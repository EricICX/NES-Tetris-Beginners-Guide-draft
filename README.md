# Hello! 
This guide is a collection of documents that should tell you everything you need to:

- Play NES Tetris
- Record your games
- Participate in online tournaments
- Prepare for real-life tournaments

This is intended as an updated version of [aGameScout's video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH5C7UDI8TI), and as such, most of the formatting will be the same.

I'll be going over 3 price ranges of gear in this basic overview:
- In a Pinch: This is all stuff that you'll probably already have laying around.
- The Essentials: This is the cheapest stuff you can get, in order to get a bare-minimum setup that'll give you a good experience.
- The Works: This is the stuff you'd want to get if you're okay with spending a little bit more money, or if you're already quite invested into the game.

In addition, for each category I'll be going over today, I will have a Down the Rabbit Hole segment that'll cover that specific category in much more depth than the basic overview. You might want to look at that if you want to read more about the concepts I'm talking about, find specific information, or want to know what ultra-high-end stuff I use as a world champion.

**Currently, this is unfinished**

Without any further ado, let's begin!

# The Game + The Game System

## In a Pinch: An emulator running an NES Tetris ROM.
<details closed>
  <summary>(dubious legality)</summary>
  
This is pretty much as basic as it gets. If you don't already know, a NES emulator is a program that lets you run NES games on a system that isn't an NES. In this case, that's probably going to be your computer, or maybe your phone.

For a NES emulator, I recommend [Mesen](https://www.mesen.ca/) (available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux)

[<img src="https://github.com/EricICX/NES-Tetris-Beginners-Guide/assets/80788439/a315abef-df74-4272-bb61-108c31396afe" width="150"/>](https://www.mesen.ca)

If your PC isn't powerful enough to run that, [nestopia-ue](http://0ldsk00l.ca/nestopia/) is another solid choice for Windows and Linux.

If you want to play on your phone, you can do that too! The two emulator apps I have experience with are [NostalgiaNes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nostalgiaemulators.neslite&hl=en_US) on Android, and [Delta Game Emulator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688) on iPhone.

However, you'll still need the game, and this is where this article takes a little bit of a... gray turn.

Legally, I can't tell you where to get a NES Tetris ROM. But what I can tell you is that the file you are looking for has either the name `Tetris (U) [!].nes` or `Tetris (USA).nes`. You don't want a file that has the name `Tetris (Europe).nes` (because that's the PAL version, not the NTSC version most people play) and you ABSOLUTELY do not want anything that is a `.exe` file. And with that bit of advice, the rest is up to you.

Once you've set up your emulator and loaded your (legally obtained) ROM, you're ready to move onto the next section.

## The Essentials: A clone console running an original cartridge.

<details closed>
  <summary>One step above In a Pinch.</summary>
  
If you don't know already, a clone console is basically a clone of the NES, as the name implies. 

The main advantages of a clone console are that they are cheap and readily available, along with also giving an experience that's good enough when compared to an original NES. 

If you'd like to know more about the differences between an original NES and a clone console, click here to go to the Down the Rabbit Hole section.

Throughout the years, I've found 3 consistent clone console options that I'm comfortable recommending:

[Gamerz Tek 8-Bit Entertainment System](https://www.amazon.com/8-Bit-Entertainment-System-Nintendo/dp/B0161N7J2G). Currently $19.99 on Amazon. 

[<img src="https://github.com/EricICX/NES-Tetris-Beginners-Guide/assets/80788439/6ae4963b-3511-49ef-8f19-378b79a674ac" height="200"/>](https://www.amazon.com/8-Bit-Entertainment-System-Nintendo/dp/B0161N7J2G)

Despite the generic-sounding name, this console comes with two very decent controllers, and if it's in stock, I recommend picking it up. Heck, I've even seen the price go as low as $14.99!

[Old Skool Classiq N](https://www.amazon.com/Skool-CLASSIQ-Console-Compatible-NES-Nintendo/dp/B07KDVMFBY). Currently $23.99 on Amazon. [Also available in gray](https://www.amazon.com/Skool-CLASSIQ-Console-Compatible-NES-Nintendo/dp/B07KDTLY7B), currently $24.99.

[<img src="https://github.com/EricICX/NES-Tetris-Beginners-Guide/assets/80788439/ac335ba8-f25a-4688-86b6-e4b78ab75e05" height="200"/>](https://www.amazon.com/Skool-CLASSIQ-Console-Compatible-NES-Nintendo/dp/B07KDVMFBY)[<img src="https://github.com/EricICX/NES-Tetris-Beginners-Guide/assets/80788439/7e5d3033-9142-435f-b9a6-2ef0ea8d5fb9" height="200"/>](https://www.amazon.com/Skool-CLASSIQ-Console-Compatible-NES-Nintendo/dp/B07KDTLY7B)

This console is another solid option. The two controllers it comes with are very usable, and this console is a favorite of many tournament organizers because of its reliability.

[Hyperkin RetroN 1 AV](https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-RetroN-Console-nintendo-entertainment-system/dp/B08ZD8QZGQ). Currently $24.99 on Amazon. [Also available in gray](https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-RetroN-Console-nintendo-entertainment-system/dp/B08ZCYK9SH), currently $24.99.

[<img src="https://github.com/EricICX/NES-Tetris-Beginners-Guide/assets/80788439/7db929dc-cbe0-4a44-80c4-4dc61cfa1dcd" height="200">](https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-RetroN-Console-nintendo-entertainment-system/dp/B08ZD8QZGQ)[<img src="https://github.com/EricICX/NES-Tetris-Beginners-Guide/assets/80788439/febf5eb7-b937-4311-b98c-8303da7854df" height="200">](https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-RetroN-Console-nintendo-entertainment-system/dp/B08ZCYK9SH)



This console is yet another solid option, and it comes with the most decent controller out of the whole bunch here. 
The Cadet controller this comes with isn't exactly like the original NES controller, but it has a similar shape, with the main differences being some rounded bits on the back, and the folded-in corners. 
This is also the only console out of the bunch that's USB powered. Micro USB though, unfortunately.

You'll also need a copy of NES Tetris. Unfortunately, it isn't possible to get these new anymore, but it's still a fairly easy game to get secondhand on sites like eBay. 
I don't personally know a whole lot about cartridge pricing, and it's likely that whatever I put here will become outdated immediately. That said, if you're not comfortable with the eBay price (which looks to be around $15 right now in mid-2024), shop around at places like local gaming stores. 

Very quickly, I will also mention that there are two versions of the game: NTSC and PAL. Since I'm American, this guide will mostly focus on NTSC Tetris. That said, there's a reasonably easy way to tell the two versions apart.

As shown below, there's a small bit of text in the bottom right of the label that shows the region. NTSC Tetris has the region label NES-EI-USA. PAL versions might have something different, like NES-EI-FRA.

[<img src="https://github.com/EricICX/NES-Tetris-Beginners-Guide/assets/80788439/fb8ac339-a431-42eb-bf28-991fe34cd696" width="350">](https://github.com/EricICX/NES-Tetris-Beginners-Guide/assets/80788439/fb8ac339-a431-42eb-bf28-991fe34cd696)

In general, you probably won't have to worry about this if you're shopping in an NTSC country, but this is definitely something that Europeans, and other PAL country residents, will have to pay attention to.

## The Works: An original NES running either a TetrisGYM or flash cartridge.

<details closed>
<summary>What most top players use.</summary>

<img src="https://github.com/EricICX/NES-Tetris-Beginners-Guide/assets/80788439/b5ae03ab-b5b7-4d56-9ac4-9a59f55e57d5" width="350">
  
If you're someone who wants something better than a clone console, and/or you want more ways to practice the game, then this section is for you.

An original NES used to be considered the gold standard, but as time goes on (the NES is nearly 40 years old as I'm writing this!), they are becoming less and less reliable. 

Along with that, these consoles are getting rarer and more expensive with age. I got my NES in 2019 for $40 or so with a controller and all the cables, and right now in mid-2024, that's how much parts consoles are selling for!

I'll go into more detail on how to look for an original NES, along with what can fail, in the Down the Rabbit Hole section.

---

What isn't as expensive, however, is additional ways to practice the game. The old advice used to be to get a Game Genie for your original cartridge, but nowadays, there are much better options.

Most top players use [TetrisGYM](https://github.com/kirjavascript/TetrisGYM), a custom version of the game that adds many practice modes and quality-of-life features. This ROM has made Game Genie codes almost completely obsolete.

Currently, there are 3 people selling TetrisGYM cartridges that you can stick in your NES or clone console. 
- [I mostly cater to the American market](https://www.tindie.com/products/26928/)
- [Techapore mostly caters to the Asian market](https://techapore.com/)
- Gunter (@gabrielbondon on Discord) mostly caters to the European market.

In most cases, this means you can get a cartridge for around $25-35. And for a lot of players, that's all they will ever need.

But if you want to try out more obscure ROM hacks, or play other games besides Tetris, you might also want to consider picking up a flash cartridge instead. They're a bit more expensive, but to some people it's worth it.
- [EverDrive N8](https://everdrive.me/cartridges/edn8nes72pin.html): Supports the vast majority of NES games. Has savestates, Game Genie code support, and expansion audio.
- [KrzysioCart](http://krzysiocart.com/): Supports 82% of all NES games, including all known Tetris hacks, but has less quality of life features than the EverDrive N8.

I'll go over more of the differences in the Down the Rabbit Hole section here.

# Your Controller

## In a Pinch: Your computer's keyboard.
<details closed>
<summary>Basically, what you already have.</summary>

This is the most basic option possible, and it's pretty self-explanatory.

That said, if you have even a little bit of money you're willing to spend, an original NES controller is the one thing I recommend buying.

## The Essentials: An original NES controller.

<details open>
<summary>The gold standard.</summary>

If you've got a little bit of money to spend, it's recommended that you get an original NES controller. If you play on a clone console or original NES, that's all you need.

Even if you play on emulator, getting an original controller (along with a NES controller to USB adapter) will help you a lot if you ever decide to transition to a console, or if you ever plan to play in real-life tournaments, because you won't have to get used to playing on a controller - you'll have been playing on one since you started. 

Speaking from experience, this approach worked well for me as a high schooler - I didn't have the money for a console at the time, but when I did, I already had the muscle memory for playing on a controller.

When it comes to buying an original controller, the one thing you should look for is a red Nintendo logo in the top right. 

<img src="https://github.com/EricICX/NES-Tetris-Beginners-Guide/assets/80788439/86b6e1ca-8d6c-4643-b9bc-1fe8474f61af" width="350">

If a controller doesn't have this, it's 100% guaranteed to be a knockoff controller. It's recommended that you stay away from knockoff controllers for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to poor quality, parts incompatibility, and just generally not feeling good to use at all.

It's also recommended to stay away from USB controllers, as most cheap ones poll at around 20-40 Hz. Basically, this means that it's impossible to be precise with your inputs at all, since 20-40 < 60.

Ultimately, an original Nintendo NES-004 controller is what you're looking for, along with a NES to USB adapter if you're playing on emulator.

## The Works: An NES controller that's good for you.

<details open>
<summary></summary>

Ultimately, what this comes down to is finding a controller that's good for you. Depending on your needs, this might be the first one you buy, the tenth one you buy, or you might have to resort to modifying a controller to get what you're after.

That said, finding a controller you like and sticking with it can really help improve your game, especially at real-life tournaments, because even though most tournaments provide controllers, having one you're comfortable with matters a lot when you need to do inputs as precise as 1/30th or 1/60th of a second.
