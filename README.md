Hello! This guide is a collection of documents that should tell you everything you need to:

- Play NES Tetris
- Record your games
- Participate in online tournaments
- Prepare for real-life tournaments

This is intended as an updated version of [aGameScout's video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH5C7UDI8TI), and as such, most of the formatting will be the same.

I'll be going over 3 price ranges of gear in this basic overview:
- In a Pinch: This is all stuff that you'll probably already have laying around.
- The Essentials: This is the cheapest stuff you can get, in order to get a bare-minimum setup that'll give you a good experience.
- The Works: This is the stuff you'd want to get if you're okay with spending a little bit more money, or if you're already quite invested into the game.

In addition, for each category I'll be going over today, I will have a Down the Rabbit Hole segment that'll cover that specific category in much more depth than the basic overview. You might want to look at that if you want to read more about the concepts I'm talking about, find specific information, or want to know what ultra-high-end stuff I use as a world champion.

Without any further ado, let's begin!

# The Game + The Game System

It might seem weird at first glance to group these two into the same category, but hopefully this will make sense.

## In a Pinch: An emulator running an NES Tetris ROM.
<details closed>
  <summary></summary>
This is pretty much as basic as it gets. If you don't already know, a NES emulator is a program that lets you run NES games on a system that isn't an NES. In this case, that's probably going to be your computer, or maybe your phone.

For a NES emulator, I recommend [Mesen][https://www.mesen.ca/], or if your PC isn't powerful enough to run that, [nestopia-ue](http://0ldsk00l.ca/nestopia/). Mesen is available for Windows, MacOS, or Linux, and nestopia-ue is available for Windows and Linux.

If you want to play on your phone, you can do that too! The two emulator apps I have experience with are [NostalgiaNes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nostalgiaemulators.neslite&hl=en_US) on Android, and [Delta Game Emulator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688) on iPhone.

However, you'll still need the game, and this is where this article takes a little bit of a... gray turn.

Legally, I can't tell you where to get a NES Tetris ROM. But what I can tell you is that the file you are looking for has either the name `Tetris (U) [!].nes` or `Tetris (USA).nes`. You don't want a file that has the name `Tetris (Europe).nes` (because that's the PAL version, not the NTSC version most people play) and you ABSOLUTELY do not want anything that is a `.exe` file. And with that bit of advice, the rest is up to you.

Once you've set up your emulator and loaded your (legally obtained) ROM, you're ready to move onto the next section.

## The Essentials: A clone console running an original cartridge.

<details closed>
If you don't know already, a clone console is basically a clone of the NES, as the name implies. 

The main advantages of a clone console are that they are cheap and readily available, along with also giving an experience that's good enough when compared to an original NES. If you'd like to know more about the differences between an original NES and a clone console, click here to go to the Down the Rabbit Hole section.

Throughout the years, I've found 3 consistent clone console options that I'm comfortable recommending:

[Gamerz Tek 8-Bit Entertainment System](https://www.amazon.com/8-Bit-Entertainment-System-Nintendo/dp/B0161N7J2G). Currently $19.99 on Amazon. 
Despite the generic-sounding name, this console comes with two very decent controllers, and if it's in stock, I recommend picking it up. Heck, I've even seen the price go as low as $14.99!

[Old Skool Classiq N](https://www.amazon.com/Skool-CLASSIQ-Console-Compatible-NES-Nintendo/dp/B07KDVMFBY). Currently $23.99 on Amazon. [Also available in gray](https://www.amazon.com/Skool-CLASSIQ-Console-Compatible-NES-Nintendo/dp/B07KDTLY7B), currently $24.99.
This console is another solid option. The two controllers it comes with are very usable, and this console is a favorite of many tournament organizers because of its reliability.

[Hyperkin RetroN 1 AV](https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-RetroN-Console-nintendo-entertainment-system/dp/B08ZD8QZGQ). Currently $24.99 on Amazon. [Also available in gray](https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-RetroN-Console-nintendo-entertainment-system/dp/B08ZCYK9SH), currently $24.99.
This console is yet another solid option, and it comes with the most decent controller out of the whole bunch here. 
The Cadet controller this comes with isn't exactly like the original NES controller, but it has a similar shape, with the main differences being some rounded bits on the back, and the folded-in corners. 
This is also the only console out of the bunch that's USB powered. Micro USB though, unfortunately.

You'll also need a copy of NES Tetris. Unfortunately, it isn't possible to get these new anymore, but it's still a fairly easy game to get secondhand on sites like eBay. 
I don't personally know a whole lot about cartridge pricing, and it's likely that whatever I put here will become outdated immediately. That said, if you're not comfortable with the eBay price (which looks to be around $15 right now in mid-2024), shop around at places like local gaming stores.
